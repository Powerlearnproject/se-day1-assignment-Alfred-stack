#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering processes that enable software creation in a timely and orderly manner to satisfy users' needs. The importance of Software Engineering (SE) can be grouped into various categories, which include scalability, accessibility and reusability, increased efficiency, cost savings, creation of reliable software, improved user experience, and security. To further elucidate, Bhatnagar (2024) maintains that specific software is needed within almost every industry. However, SE allows organizations to upscale IT infrastructure in the technology industry and develop high-quality, reliable software solutions, Ncube (2023). in addition, the categories mentioned earlier are provided through SE to reduce costs, improve customer service, which is quite important to the technology sector, and generate revenue streams.

Mohammed (2020) argues that SE's influence on the technology industry is unchallengeable because it drives digital transformation, reveals data insights, maintains adequate security, and has many other benefits. However, it also pushes boundaries, invariably advancing other areas, including 5G technology, quantum computing, and nanotechnology. Germain and Robillar (2005).



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The key milestones in the evolution of Software Engineering (SE) date back to the 1950s, before the term was coined; however, three key milestones of the evolution of SE are the 1968 NATO conference of SE, which marked the birth of the term "Software Engineering. " In addition, this conference recognized the need to improve systematic approaches to software development and help address the software crisis. Águila et al. (2014).
The second milestone was the introduction of structured programming in the 1970s, which gave rise to the use of control structures like loops and conditionals, which prompted the creation of more reliable and maintainable software. However, in this phase, languages like Pascal and Fortran were introduced.
The third phase was the Agile Manifesto in 2001, which is now referred to as the Agile Methodology used in the software development cycle. This key milestone transformed the SE to promote iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. In summary, there are about six key milestones and counting as the innovative aspect of technology continues to improve. Software Heritage (2021).

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

According to Nwachukwu (2010), the phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes 
1. Requirement
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Construction

However, these phases can be further outline into 
1. Phase 1- Project Intitiation.
2. Phase 2- Feasibility Study (which includes Technical Feasibility, Economic Feasibility, Legal Feasibility, Operational Feasibility, and Schedule Feasibility).
3. Phase 3- Analysis
4. Phase 4- Specification
5. Phase 5- Technical Design
6. Phase 6- Construction
7. Phase 7- Implementation
8. Phase 8- Post-implementation Review.


To briefly elucidate, the requirement analysis is the first phase of SDLC. It involves gathering and defining the software requirements from stakeholders, which are streamlined to meet the requirements of consumers. 

* The design phase involves planning the software's architecture, interface, and data structures.
  
* The implementation phase: As the name implies, the objective of this phase is to ensure that the system performs as required. However, this involves writing actual codes to build the software based on the design documents that would have been created during the technical design phase.
  
* Testing: As the name suggests, this phase involves a comprehensive process of validating and verifying that the software meets the specific requirements gathered in the first phase. It ensures that the software is not just free of defects but also performs as expected. Various types of testing, such as Beta and Alpha testing, are also performed during various stages of production. In summary, deployment is done during this phase, which is about releasing software to the production environment, Daily Magazine (2021).
  
* Maintenance: This phase is similar to the post-implementation review in the previous phases; however, at this stage, ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates are done after the software has been deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


According to the Atlassian blog, Waterfall methodology was originally coined by the computer scientist Winston Royce in his 1970 research paper, "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems" (Royce, 1987). Conversely, Senarath (2021) maintains that selecting a suitable method when undertaking a project can be a difficult decision. Therefore, the waterfall methodology aligns with methodologies utilized in project management. 

Waterfall methodology can be defined as a thorough linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next phase begins. following the illustration of the cascading downward visual representation of the waterfall, this methodology sequentially passes through five stages: requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance). Atlassian.
Real-life scenarios where waterfall methodology can be applied include construction, software development, and manufacturing projects. Santiago (2022) describes an effective use of the waterfall methodology in implementing library projects. The structured use of this methodology can help library administrators ensure the efficient use of resources for project completion and also set up the project's environment.

Conversely, Agile methodology is a group of software development methods that allow iteration and incremental development. According to Kumar and Bhatia (2012), the difference between Waterfall methodology and Agile methodology is significant. While both have their advantages and disadvantages, Agile stands out for its flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. In contrast, Waterfall remains stringent in its step-by-step process, which can limit adaptability and responsiveness to change.

Furthermore, Agile methodology is widely used for various industry projects as a lightweight development method that can satisfy changing requirements, Kumar and Bhatia (2012). An example of the application of Agile methodology is building a mobile app for a start-up where user feedback will continually shape ongoing development. 



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Several key team members must be present to tackle the challenges associated with producing software, such as compromising quality. However, it is suggested that "not all teams require engineers, but these three 'Software Developers', 'Quality Assurance Engineers,' and 'Project Managers' are important to the successful creation of software, and the roles and responsibilities of each team member include. Águila (2014)

1. Software Developer: These team members are responsible for the software and technology necessary for building and developing systems and applications using engineering principles and programming languages. They write, test, and maintain the codes used to create software. However, they are also responsible for implementing the software design and fixing bugs.

2. Quality Assurance Engineer (QAE): According to Heera (2024), the QAE is responsible for testing software products throughout development. They ensure that the software created is high quality through various testing methods. However, their roles also involve maintenance because they identify defects and verify they are fixed before release.

3. Project Manager (PM): The PM is also an essential part of the SE team because these individuals manage the project timeline and resources and maintain adequate communication throughout the project phases. In short, the PM oversees the entire project, focusing on scope, schedule, and budget.

   

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are comprehensive software suites with various tools essential for software development in a unified platform. One major importance of an IDE is that it helps streamline the development process and improve productivity. Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio Code and Intelligent Idea. These tools include a code editor, compiler, debugger, code formatting, code analyzer, code navigator, etc. 

Version Control Systems (VCS), also known as version control or source control systems, enable tracking and managing changes to a file system. This software utility also offers collaborative utilities to share and integrate file system changes with other VCS users, like software teams.
In addition, VCS, as mentioned earlier, is vital in collaborative environments like software development systems for managing contributions from multiple team members, avoiding code conflicts, and managing project coherence and progress. Secoda (2024) Therefore, the importance of VCS can be listed as follows;

1. Collaboration
2. Change tracking
3. Branching and Merging
4. Error Recovery
5. Concurrent Modification
6. Conflict Resolution
7. Progress Monitoring
8. Centralized Control

Examples of VCS include Git and Subversion.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Developing and launching new software can be complicated. Each step of the development and approval process has many variables. While things can go right, even more can go wrong—and with missteps comes the possibility of returning to square one.
As frustrating as these obstacles are, there are ways to overcome them without severely hindering your progress. Below are some of the most common issues that arise during a software development project and how teams can solve them.

1. Lack of workflow visibility: This crucial software engineering challenge stems from internal factors within a software development team. It occurs as a result of a vague understanding of the engineering processes within an organization, such as a proper breakdown of software development life cycle (SDLC) processes, lack of communication, and lack of effective team collaboration (Chaudhary, 2024).
2. Managing Complexity: this challenge occurs due to software growth because it becomes more complex to manage as software grows.
3. Ensuring code quality: This challenge involves ensuring that the codes written are not of poor quality, which can lead to bugs and maintenance issues.
4. Scalability, security, and performance challenges: in SE, a software application must always be designed for scalability, security, and re-usability. These are fundamental concepts that should be applied in the SE production process. However, some engineers have different expertise and coding styles, which may not be convenient for their colleagues; for instance, some engineers would not properly comment on their codes, which would make it difficult for their colleagues to understand what their thought process was when writing the code and can affect re-usability.
In addition, inappropriate access management can also lead to security vulnerabilities; on the other hand, poor infrastructure configuration can also lead to performance and scalability challenges. Chaudhary (2024).
5. Communication Breakdowns: The lack of communication can not be overstated because every software development team requires a team to collaborate to address consumer needs. Therefore, effective communication can enable every member to know a project's coding strategy, objectives, and goals. Other challenges include unrealistic or mismanaged timelines, prioritization of tasks, feature overload, lack of alignment between sponsor and user needs, underestimating the task at hand, and Not pinpointing the real 'Why', amongst others.

Improving these challenges includes defining coding standards to write scalable code, using security testing tools and platforms to improve security, investing in tools that empower decision-making processes such as project management tools, implementing modular design, and adhering to coding standards to manage software complexity.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Alongside the software development process there lies the software testing and its procedures, these testing levels can be distinguished into unit testing, integrating testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (TM).

1. Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work as intended. Unit testing is usually performed at the early stage of the development process by the engineers themselves and not the team. 
The importance of unit testing includes the early detection of bugs in the development process before they become more difficult and expensive to fix, as well as ensuring modularization of code for better understanding and maintainability. 

2. System testing is performed by a highly professional team that includes Business analysts, product owners, and Manual QA in an environment as close to the real business use scenario as possible, According to Geeks for Geeks (2024) this software testing is the test that evaluates the total functionality and performance of the fully functional software solution.

3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) or End-to-End tests:
This process involves validating the product against the end users' requirements. This is also considered the last stage of the testing process that ensures customers' expectations are met, verifying the acceptance tests on the stories and the features. 
The importance of this test lies in the fact that the UAT helps the team decide if the product is ready to be shipped or not. 

4. Acceptance testing involves validating the software with real-life scenarios which is almost similar to beta testing where the software is issued to the public to use and return feedback to enable the team to ensure that it meets the end-user's needs and is ready for deployment. 

However, in general, each test serves its purpose in identifying defects at different stages of development, ensuring that the final product is ready for use. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Amazon defines prompt engineering by breaking down each concept. For instance, a prompt is a natural language that requests generative AI to perform a specific task, while prompt engineering involves the continuous refinement of prompts until the desired outcomes from the AI system are achieved. Amazon Blog (2024).
Prompt engineering is important because it includes improved user experience and control and increased flexibility.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Tell me about Machine Learning"
Improved Prompt: "Explain the various types of Machine Learning Techniques and provide a detailed definition of Machine learning."

Explanation: the improved prompt is more specific and clear because, unlike the vague prompt, "Machine learning" is a broad concept, and requesting the Generative AI to tell you about machine learning will result in an ambiguous explanation. However, by providing the improved prompt that guides AI to provide a detailed and relevant response, such ambiguity will be eliminated, and make the output more useful and streamlined for the user.
