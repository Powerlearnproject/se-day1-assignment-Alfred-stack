#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering processes that enable software creation in a timely and orderly manner to satisfy users' needs. The importance of Software Engineering (SE) can be grouped into various categories, which include scalability, accessibility and reusability, increased efficiency, cost savings, creation of reliable software, improved user experience, and security. To further elucidate, Bhatnagar (2024) maintains that specific software is needed within almost every industry. However, SE allows organizations to upscale IT infrastructure in the technology industry and develop high-quality, reliable software solutions, Ncube (2023). in addition, the categories mentioned earlier are provided through SE to reduce costs, improve customer service, which is quite important to the technology sector, and generate revenue streams.

Mohammed (2020) argues that SE's influence on the technology industry is unchallengeable because it drives digital transformation, reveals data insights, maintains adequate security, and has many other benefits. However, it also pushes boundaries, invariably advancing other areas, including 5G technology, quantum computing, and nanotechnology. Germain and Robillar (2005).



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The key milestones in the evolution of Software Engineering (SE) date back to the 1950s, before the term was coined; however, three key milestones of the evolution of SE are the 1968 NATO conference of SE, which marked the birth of the term "Software Engineering. " In addition, this conference recognized the need to improve systematic approaches to software development and help address the software crisis. Águila et al. (2014).
The second milestone was the introduction of structured programming in the 1970s, which gave rise to the use of control structures like loops and conditionals, which prompted the creation of more reliable and maintainable software. However, in this phase, languages like Pascal and Fortran were introduced.
The third phase was the Agile Manifesto in 2001, which is now referred to as the Agile Methodology used in the software development cycle. This key milestone transformed the SE to promote iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. In summary, there are about six key milestones and counting as the innovative aspect of technology continues to improve. Software Heritage (2021).

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

According to Nwachukwu (2010), the phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes 
1. Requirement
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Construction

However, these phases can be further outline into 
1. Phase 1- Project Intitiation.
2. Phase 2- Feasibility Study (which includes Technical Feasibility, Economic Feasibility, Legal Feasibility, Operational Feasibility, and Schedule Feasibility).
3. Phase 3- Analysis
4. Phase 4- Specification
5. Phase 5- Technical Design
6. Phase 6- Construction
7. Phase 7- Implementation
8. Phase 8- Post-implementation Review.


To briefly elucidate, the requirement analysis is the first phase of SDLC. It involves gathering and defining the software requirements from stakeholders, which are streamlined to meet the requirements of consumers. 

* The design phase involves planning the software's architecture, interface, and data structures.
  
* The implementation phase: As the name implies, the objective of this phase is to ensure that the system performs as required. However, this involves writing actual codes to build the software based on the design documents that would have been created during the technical design phase.
  
* Testing: As the name suggests, this phase involves a comprehensive process of validating and verifying that the software meets the specific requirements gathered in the first phase. It ensures that the software is not just free of defects but also performs as expected. Various types of testing, such as Beta and Alpha testing, are also performed during various stages of production. In summary, deployment is done during this phase, which is about releasing software to the production environment, Daily Magazine (2021).
  
* Maintenance: This phase is similar to the post-implementation review in the previous phases; however, at this stage, ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates are done after the software has been deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


According to the Atlassian blog, Waterfall methodology was originally coined by the computer scientist Winston Royce in his 1970 research paper, "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems" (Royce, 1987). Conversely, Senarath (2021) maintains that selecting a suitable method when undertaking a project can be a difficult decision. Therefore, the waterfall methodology aligns with methodologies utilized in project management. 

Waterfall methodology can be defined as a thorough linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next phase begins. following the illustration of the cascading downward visual representation of the waterfall, this methodology sequentially passes through five stages: requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance). Atlassian.
Real-life scenarios where waterfall methodology can be applied include construction, software development, and manufacturing projects. Santiago (2022) describes an effective use of the waterfall methodology in implementing library projects. The structured use of this methodology can help library administrators ensure the efficient use of resources for project completion and also set up the project's environment.

Conversely, Agile methodology is a group of software development methods that allow iteration and incremental development. According to Kumar and Bhatia (2012), the difference between Waterfall methodology and Agile methodology is significant. While both have their advantages and disadvantages, Agile stands out for its flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. In contrast, Waterfall remains stringent in its step-by-step process, which can limit adaptability and responsiveness to change.

Furthermore, Agile methodology is widely used for various industry projects as a lightweight development method that can satisfy changing requirements, Kumar and Bhatia (2012). An example of the application of Agile methodology is building a mobile app for a start-up where user feedback will continually shape ongoing development. 



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Several key team members must be present to tackle the challenges associated with producing software, such as compromising quality. However, it is suggested that "not all teams require engineers, but these three 'Software Developers', 'Quality Assurance Engineers,' and 'Project Managers' are important to the successful creation of software, and the roles and responsibilities of each team member include.

1. Software Developer: These team members are responsible for the software and technology necessary for building and developing systems and applications using engineering principles and programming languages. They write, test, and maintain the codes used to create software. However, they are also responsible for implementing the software design and fixing bugs.

2. Quality Assurance Engineer (QAE): According to Heera (2024), the QAE is responsible for testing software products throughout the development process. They ensure that the software created is high quality through various testing methods. However, their roles also involve maintenance because they identify defects and verify they are fixed before release.

3. Project Manager (PM): The PM is also an essential part of the SE team because these individuals manage the project timeline and resources and maintain adequate communication throughout the project phases. In short, the PM oversees the entire project, focusing on scope, schedule, and budget.

   

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
